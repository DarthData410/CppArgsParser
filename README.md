# CppArgsParser README

This project contains logic for a "smart" C/C++ arguments parser that detects if the argument values being passed in are string, boolean, int, float(double), etc. This allows for working with C-Type data, being passed in from the execution point of a C/C++ main. 

The scope of this work was created using vscode, and compiled using g++.
